# "Money" Expressions - 2

Now, the VOA Special English program ==**WORDS AND THEIR STORIES**==.

Most people enjoy working for several reasons. Their job might be fun, or they like their employer and the other people at work. Most people I know, however, work for the money. I do not know anyone who is ==**loaded,**== or extremely rich.  Most of my friends work to earn enough money to live. They have to ==**make ends meet.**== They have to earn enough money to pay for the things they need. Some even live ==**from hand to mouth.**== They only have enough money for the most important things.

They struggle to earn enough money ==**to bring home the bacon.**== It can be difficult to earn enough money for a family to survive. Sometimes, poor people even get ==**caught short.**==  They do not have enough money to pay for what they need.

Or they have to spend or ==**lay out**== more money than they want for something. When this happens, poor people have to ==**tighten their belts**== and live on less money than usual. I hate when I have to live on less money. It takes me longer to get ==**back on my feet**==, or return to good financial health.

However, other people are on the==** gravy train.**== They get paid more money than their job is worth. These people ==**make a bundle.**==  They really ==**rake in the cash**==. In fact, they make so much money that they can ==**live high off the hog.**== They own the best of everything and live in great ease. Sometimes they ==**pay an arm and a leg for something.**==

Because ==**m**====**oney is no object**== to wealthy people, they will pay high prices for whatever they want. Sometimes, they even ==**pay through the nose.**==  They pay too much for things.

I am not rich. I did not ==**make a killing**== in the stock market when my stocks increased in value. Yet, I am not poor either. When I go out with friends, I do not want to ==**shell out**== or pay a lot of money. Often, my friends and I will ==**chip in**== or pay jointly for a fun night out. When we go to restaurants the meal is==** Dutch treat**==.  Each person pays his or her own share.

Once, the owner of a restaurant gave us a dinner ==**on the house.**== We did not have to pay for our meals. However, I admit that we had to ==**grease someone's palm.**== We had to pay money to the employee who led us to our table. The money was for a special request. Yes, it was a ==**buy off.**== The employee put us at the top of the list for a table instead of making us wait like everyone else. We had a great time that night and the meal did not ==**set me back**== at all.  I did not have to pay anything.

Because of that experience, I will always remember that nice things still happen in a world that is driven by money. But, that is just my ==**two cents worth.**== It is just my opinion.
