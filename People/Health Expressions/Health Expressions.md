# Health Expressions

Now, the VOA Special English program ==**WORDS AND THEIR STORIES**==.

Many professions have their own words and expressions.  This is true for the medical profession.  Doctors use many technical terms that most people do not understand. But there are also expressions we use every day to tell about a person's health.  Let me explain.

Last month, I was not feeling well.  I was ==**under the weather**==.  I thought I had ==**caught a**====** cold**==.  I had a ==**runny nose,**== itchy eyes, a sore throat and a cough.  I felt tired and ==**run down**==.  I was in poor condition because I had not been getting enough rest.

My body hurt all over.  I also had severe head pains -- a real ==**splitting headache**==.  And I was ==**running a fever**==.  My body temperature was higher than normal.

At one point, I ==**blacked out**==.  That's right, I was ==**out cold**==.  I lost consciousness and my friend had to ==**bring me around**==.  He used cold water on my face to restore my consciousness.

I grew concerned that I might ==**take a turn for the worse**==.  I did not want to become sicker because then surely I would be ==**at death's door.**==

My friend took me to the doctor.  I told the doctor I thought I had ==**come down with a cold.**== When the doctor saw me, she immediately wanted to ==**run some tests**==.  She said that medical tests would help her discover why I was sick.  The doctor also asked when I had my last ==**physical**==.  I do not get yearly ==**check-ups**==.  But I probably should get a medical exam by a doctor every year.

Then the nurse ==**drew my blood**==. She used a needle to take a small amount of blood from my arm.  She sent it to a laboratory for tests.  The nurse also ==**took my temperature**==.==**  **== She used a thermometer to measure my body temperature.

The doctor told me I had influenza, or ==**the flu.**==  But she told me I would recover soon.  She said I was==** over the worst**== of the disease. She told me to rest at home and to stay away from other people because the flu can spread.  It is ==**contagious**==.

Thankfully, I did not have to ==**go under the knife**==.  I did not need an operation.  Instead, I did ==**just what the doctor ordered**==.  I went home and did exactly what was needed to become healthy again.  Soon, I was ==**on the mend**==.  I was==** pulling through**== and recovering from my sickness.

Now, I am ==**back on my feet**==.  I am physically healthy again.  Even better, the doctor has given me a ==**clean bill of health**==.  She says that I am one-hundred percent cured.  I am back to normal and I feel great.  In fact, I ==**feel on top of the world**==.  My friends say I now ==**look like the picture of health.**==
