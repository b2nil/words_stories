# Expressions with the Word "Hair"

Now, the VOA Special English program ==**WORDS AND THEIR STORIES**==.

A listener named Rita wants to learn about expressions with the word "hair."  So we will tell a story.

Yesterday when I woke up, I looked in a mirror.  I looked very neat and organized.  ==**Not a hair was out of place**==.  But today when I woke up, I knew I was going to ==**have a bad hair day**==.  My hair was standing up in all the wrong places.  I thought I would be unhappy all day and things would not go well.  I work at home so I just hoped that my computer would work right and not have a bad hair day also.

I was very tired because I did not sleep well last night.  I made the mistake of watching a horror movie on television.  The movie really ==**made my hair stand on end.**==  It was about a house possessed by evil spirits.  The thought of having to live alone in a house like that was so frightening it was enough to ==**curl your hair**==.  I will say it another way: watching that movie was ==**a hair-raising experience.**==

I prepared a meal for my children but they were behaving badly.  I turned on the television so they would be quiet.  I did not want them to be difficult or ==**to get in my hair**== while I was working on the computer.

My children were making so much noise that I could not work.  I was getting angry.  In fact, I was ready to ==**pull my hair out.**==  I told them to please be quiet or I would punish them.  But they knew I would not ==**harm a hair on their heads**==.

I decided to make myself some strong coffee so I could work better.  But my drink was so strong that it could ==**put hair on your chest.**==

Finally, I got back to work.  I was writing a proposal for a project.  I knew that I was very close to finishing the proposal.  Success was very close – within ==**a hair's breadth**==.  My supervisor called me to discuss the project.  She wanted to argue about very small differences and unimportant details.  But I told her not to ==**split hairs**==.

Later, I got a telephone call from a friend whom I had not seen in a long time.  In fact, I had not seen ==**hide nor hair**== of him in months.  So I was glad to know that he was all right.

I worked all day and finished my project.  So I decided to celebrate, have some fun and ==**let my hair down.**==  I played some old recordings, and my children and I danced around the room.  The recordings are from my favorite musical, a show called "Hair."  It takes place during the nineteen sixties when many young people wore their hair very long.
