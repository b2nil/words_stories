# Proverbs 4 - Some Listeners' Favorite Sayings

Now, the VOA Special English program ==**WORDS AND THEIR STORIES**==.

A proverb is a short, well known saying that expresses a common truth or belief.  Many proverbs give advice about the best way to live.

Recently, we presented a program about proverbs.  We asked our listeners to send us their favorite proverbs.  A short time later, we received suggestions from around the world.  We heard from listeners in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America.

The top proverb among these listeners is this one: ==**"Where there is a will, there is a way."  **== This means that you can rise above your problems if you have a goal and work very hard.

Some listeners liked another proverb: ==**"Strike while the iron is hot."**==  This means it is best to take action quickly and at the right time.  Another favorite proverb was, ==**"God helps those who help themselves."**==

Xu Da-ju from China wrote that his country has thousands of proverbs.  Several of them are also used in the United States.  One example is "==**Birds of a feather flock together."**==  This means that people who are alike often become friends or spend time together.

Another proverb is ==**"Blood is thicker than water."**==  This means family ties are stronger than other relationships.  A similar proverb states ==**"Charity begins at home."  **==A person should help his family or close friends before helping others.

Alina from China sent us this proverb: ==**"He who would climb a ladder must begin at the bottom."  **== That is good advice when working around your home or looking for a job.

Antonio Jose from Brazil says his favorite proverb is ==**"Tell me who walks with you, and I'll tell you who you are."**==  Didier Vermeulen of France sent us this one: ==**"It does not matter the speed you go.  The most important thing is to never stop."**==

Wafaa from Egypt says her favorite proverb is, ==**"Think twice, act wise."**==  She also says she is making an effort to use this saying in her life.

Another favorite proverb among our listeners is ==**"Practice makes perfect."  **==This means you will become good at something if you keep doing it.  Another popular proverb is: ==**"If you want something done right, do it yourself."**==

Najeeb from Afghanistan sent us this proverb: ==**"If you risk nothing, then you risk everything."**==

And, here is the favorite proverb of Marius Meledje in Ivory Coast:  ==**"Your defeat now is your victory in the future."**==  He says it means you can learn from your mistakes.  This will help you do better when facing similar situations in the future.
