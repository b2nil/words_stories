# Some People's Names Have Special Meanings in American Expressions

Now, the VOA Special English program ==**WORDS AND THEIR STORIES**==.

A person's name is very important. Some names also have special meanings in popular American expressions.  To better understand what I mean, sit back and listen.  You might even want to get a==** cup of Joe**==, I mean, a cup of coffee.

One day, ==**an average Joe**== was walking down the street.  An average Joe is a common person – either male or female.  This average Joe was lost.  He ==**did not know Jack**== about where he was going.  By this, I mean he did not know anything about where to find things in the city.

"==**Jeez Louise**==," said John Q. Public.  This is an expression of surprise.  "Jeez Louise, don't you know that all banks are closed today?  It is Saturday."

"For Pete's sake.  I do not believe you," said average Joe.  He was being ==**a doubting Thomas**==, someone who does not believe anything he is told.

Average Joe asked the woman if all banks were closed on Saturday.  "No way, Jose," she answered.  This is a way of saying "no."  "==**No way, Jose**==.  Many banks are open on Saturdays."

When he arrived, he walked to the desk of the chief bank employee.  Now this man was a true ==**Jack of all trades**==.  He knew how to do everything.

As average Joe left the bank he began to sing.  But sadly, average Joe was not a good singer.  He was a ==**Johnny One Note**==.  He could only sing one note.
