# Expressions with the Word "Heart" - 2

Now, the VOA Special English program ==**WORDS AND THEIR STORIES**==.

Each week, this program explains the many meanings of English expressions. Today's expressions include a very important word – heart. 

We will try to ==**get to the heart of the matter**== to better understand the most important things about ==**WORDS AND THEIR STORIES**==.  So ==**take heart.**==  Have no fear about learning new expressions.  Besides, popular English words can be fun.  There is no need for a ==**heavy heart.**==  Such feelings of sadness would only ==**break my heart,**== or make me feel unhappy and hopeless.

Now, let us suppose you and I were speaking freely about something private.  We would be having a ==**heart to heart**== discussion.  I might speak from ==**the bottom of my heart,**== or say things honestly and truthfully.  I might even ==**open up my heart**== to you and tell a secret.  I would speak with ==**all my heart,**== or with great feeling.

When a person shares her feelings freely and openly like this, you might say she ==**wears her heart on her sleeve,**== or on her clothing.  Her emotions are not protected.

If we had an honest discussion, both of us would know that the other person's ==**heart is in the right place.**==  For example, I would know that you are a ==**kind-hearted**== and well-meaning person.  And, if you are a very good person, I would even say that you have ==**a heart of gold.**==  However, you might have a ==**change of heart**== based on what I tell you.  Our discussion might cause you to change the way you feel about something.

But, let us suppose you get angry over what I tell you. Or worse, you feel no sympathy or understanding for me or my situation.  If this happens, I might think that you have a ==**heart of stone.**==  And, if you say something to make me frightened or worried, my ==**heart might stand still**== or ==**skip a beat.**==

Yet, even though you may be angry, I would know that ==**at heart,**== you are a kind person.  In reality, you do care.  And any argument between us would not cause me to ==**lose heart**== or feel a sense of loss.

==**My heart goes out**== to anyone who loses a friend over an argument.  It really is a sad situation, and I feel sympathy for the people involved.

I promise that what I have told you today is true – ==**cross my heart.**==

I really wanted to play some music at the end of this feature.  In fact, ==**I had my heart set on it.**== So here it is, "Don't Go Breaking my Heart" by Elton John.
