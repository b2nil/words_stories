# "Money" Expressions - 1

Now, the VOA Special English program ==**WORDS AND THEIR STORIES**==.

I think people everywhere dream about having lots of money. I know I do. I would give anything to ==**make money hand over fist.**== I would like to earn large amounts of money. You could win a large amount of money in the United States through ==**lotteries**==. People pay money for tickets with numbers. If your combination of numbers is chosen, you win a huge amount of money – often in the millions. Winning the lottery is ==**a windfall**==.

A few years ago, my friend Al won the lottery. It changed his life. He did not have a rich family. He was not ==**born with a silver spoon in his mouth.**==  Instead, my friend was always ==**hard up**== for cash. He did not have much money. And the money he did earn was ==**chicken feed**== – very little.

Sometimes Al even had to accept ==**hand-outs,**== gifts from his family and friends.  But do not get me wrong. My friend was not a ==**deadbeat.**== He was not the kind of person who never paid the money he owed. He simply ==**pinched pennies.**== He was always very careful with the money he spent. In fact, he was often a ==**cheapskate.**==  He did not like to spend money. The worst times were when he was ==**flat broke**== and had no money at all.

One day, Al ==**scraped together**== a few dollars for a lottery ticket. He thought he would never ==**strike it rich**== or gain lots of money unexpectedly. But his combination of numbers was chosen and he won the lottery. He ==**hit the jackpot.**==  He won a great deal of money.

Al was so excited. The first thing he did was buy a costly new car. He ==**splurged**== on the one thingthat he normally would not buy. Then he started spending money on unnecessary things. He started to waste it. It was like he had ==**money to burn.**==  He had more money than he needed and it was ==**burning a hole in his pocket**== so he spent it quickly.

When we got together for a meal at a restaurant, Al paid every time. He would always ==**foot the bill,**== and ==**pick up the tab.**== He told me the money made him ==**feel like a million dollars.**== He was very happy.

But, Al spent too much money. Soon my friend was ==**down and out**== again. He had no money left. He was back to being ==**strapped for cash.**== He had spent his ==**bottom dollar,**== his very last amount. He did not even build up a ==**nest egg.**== He had not saved any of the money.

I admit I do feel sorry for my friend. He had enough money to live like a king. Instead, he is back to living ==**on a shoestring --**== a very low budget. Some might say he is ==**penny wise and pound foolish**==. He was wise about small things, but not about important things.
