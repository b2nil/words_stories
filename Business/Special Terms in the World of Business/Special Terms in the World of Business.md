# Special Terms in the World of Business

Now, the VOA Special English program ==**WORDS AND THEIR STORIES**==.

There are many special terms in the world of business.

The following story is about a ==**sweetheart deal**== which I made last week. I made the deal with a friend, and we both made a profit.

I had started a small company several years ago. I worked hard to make it successful. It was a sign-making business. It was a small company, not a ==**blue chip company**==. It was not known nationally for the quality of its signs. It did not make millions of dollars in profits. And it was private. It was not a public company with shares traded on the stock market.

Still, I worked hard building up my business. I did not work only a few hours each day -- no ==**banker's hours**== for me. Instead I spent many hours each day, seven days a week, trying to grow the company. I never ==**cut corners**== or tried to save on expenses. I made many ==**cold calls**==. I called on possible buyers from a list of people I had never seen. Such calls were often ==**hard sells**==. I had to be very firm.

Sometimes I sold my signs ==**at a loss**==. I did not make money on my product. When this happened, there were ==**cut backs**==. I had to use fewer supplies and reduce the number of workers. But after several years, the company ==**broke even**==. Profits were equal to expenses. And soon after, I began to ==**gain ground**==. My signs were selling very quickly. They were ==**selling like hotcakes**==.

I was happy. The company was moving forward and making real progress. It was ==**in the black**==, not ==**in the red**==. The company was making money, not losing it.

My friend knew about my business. He is a leader in the sign-making industry â€“ a real ==**big gun**==, if you know what I mean. He offered to buy my company. My friend wanted to ==**take it public**==. He wanted to sell shares in the company to the general public.

My friend believed it was best ==**to strike while the iron is hot**==. He wanted to take action at the best time possible and not wait. He offered me a ==**ball park estimate**== of the amount he would pay to buy my company. But I knew his uneducated guess was low. My company was worth much more. He asked his ==**bean-counter**== to ==**crunch the numbers**==. That is, he asked his accountant to take a close look at the finances of my company and decide how much it was worth. Then my friend increased his offer.

My friend's official offer was finally given to me ==**in black and white**==. It was written on paper and more than I ever dreamed. I was finally able to ==**get a break**==. I made a huge profit on my company, and my friend also got a ==**bang for the buck**==. He got a successful business for the money he spent.
